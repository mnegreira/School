sudo apt-get install vim

sudo vim /etc/resolv.conf

This will open the Vim editor (same commands as Vi). You want a single line it as follows:

nameserver 192.168.2.1
This tells the Pi to use the Mac as its DNS server, rather like you might expect with a connection to a home router.
Having saved the changes, we now need to set the static configuration for the Ethernet port. 
We’ll use Vim again, this time enter the following command:

sudo vim.tiny /etc/network/interfaces

This time there are a few more lines to add. 
If you want to make sure you don’t forget your existing Ethernet settings, you can comment them out with a hash. 
Otherwise, your settings should look as follows:

auto eth0
iface eth0 inet static
address 192.168.2.2
netmask 255.255.255.0
gateway 192.168.2.1
This tells the Pi to adopt the 192.168.2.2 address permanently using the Mac as the IP gateway with corresponding subnet mask.
